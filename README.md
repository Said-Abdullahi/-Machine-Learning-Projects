# -Machine-Learning-Projects

## Overview

This repository contains three academic projects completed as part of **SIT720: Machine Learning** at Deakin University. Each project focuses on real-world datasets and applies a range of machine learning techniques for classification and regression tasks. The projects are designed to develop foundational and advanced machine learning skills, including data preprocessing, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and result interpretation.
